# QUAKE 4 MOD

### Build instructions

Create .env file in the directory
```
MODNAME="name"
QUAKEDIR="path/to/quake"
BUILDDIR="path/to/build"
```
- MODNAME = name of the mod, doesn't really matter
- QUAKEDIR = path to where the quake 4 executable is
- BUILDDIR = where the game dll is stored after it is done building

Doesn't work if there are spaces in any of the fields

  ### RUN GAME

  Assuming the .env is made correctly, type ./run in the terminal to run the mod.

  ### HOW TO PLAY

  TBD
